React programmatically navigate to url

There are two main ways to programmatically navigate to an url with React:
- using the `window.location` object 
- using the React Router `useNavigate()` hook

This article will try to show both ways. 

## Programmatically navigate in React with window.location

The [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) is the goto tool when you want to navigate to a specific URL and your React app is not managed by the React Router. 

We can use one of the below approaches:

```jsx
// will not be able to use browser's back
window.location.replace(url)

// ok to use browser's back button
window.location.href = url
```

The first line will not create a new browser history entry, therfore the back will not work. While the second button will create this entry. 

I've made a small React app to ilustrate:

And beflow is the code for it:

You can see the Github repo for it, and here is the live working example.

## Navigate using the React Router v6 and above with useNavigate() hook

Starting from version `6.0.0` of React Router we have a new hook named [useNavigate()](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate) that handles the programmatic navigation. 

Beflow you have an example of a React app that uses this hook:
```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Route, Routes, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const Index = ()=> {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(
        () => navigate('/welcome', { replace: true })
    , 3000);
  }, []);
  return <>Redirecting to the Welcome page.</>;
}

const App = ()=> {
    return (
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
            <Route path="welcome" element={<> 🙌 Welcome </>} />
        </Routes>
    )
}
```

We can pass in a delta (an interger number) to the `useNavigate()` hook and go back and forth in the browser's history:
```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate()

// 👈 goes back like the browser’s “Back” button
navigate(-1)

// 👈 goes forward like the browser’s “Forward” button
navigate(1)
```

## React Router v5 and useHistory (legacy)
React Router version 5 had a similar method called [useHistory()](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/usehistory), which served a similar purpose as the useNavigate() hook introduced in later versions. 

If you're using version 5 or earlier, here's how you to navigate to url:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  const history = useHistory();
  const handleClick = () => history.push('/exit');

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
      Goodbye 👋👋👋
    </button>
  );
};
```
